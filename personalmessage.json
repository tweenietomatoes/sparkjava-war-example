//Hi, i guess youre interested in java web development with easy way :D .
//Sadly we cant send pm to people in github so i couldnt reach you.
//I was in same position as you.

//I recommend you to try javalin. https://javalin.io/
//Javalin is more actively maintained than Spark.

//Also pippo is another option. Javalin is jetty embedded as you know and
//many parts forked from spark.

//Well pippo.ro is servlet based so you can use any web server you want.

//Another framework
//Jooby is servlet based and most performant framework and many server options.
//Undertow is fastest option and Netty is also perfect as you know from vertx.

//Well i recommend Javalin for enterprise case, David aka Tipsy (from Spark Contributors) is leading that project.

//good luck"
